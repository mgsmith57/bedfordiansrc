<h3 class="embolden">19<sup>th</sup> July 2024</h3>
<p>A creditable performance by the Bedfordians representing Bedfordshire in the Astor County Championship shot over 300,
    500 and 600 yards, finishing 7th with a score of 617.75.</p>
<p>The Schools Veterans match at 500 yards brings together former pupils from many schools across the country and there
    is always a bit of a party atmosphere. It was great to have two Bedfordians teams representing the School and both
    the A and B teams were placed 13th with scores of 242.26 and 229.20 respectively.</p>
