title: Target Rifle Shooting

<p>
    Fullbore target rifle shooting is a Commonwealth Games sport. We use rifles specifically designed for target
    shooting, firing single rounds of 7.62mm/.308 inch calibre. The rifles have aperture sights rather than
    telescopic sights and can be adjusted for elevation (depending on the distance fired) and for wind.

<p>
    We shoot in a prone position over distances from 300 to 1,000 yards. Most shooters wear a stiff leather or canvas
    shooting jacket with a single point sling attached to the jacket and rifle to steady their aim.

    Targets are black circles on a white background and are either scored (or “marked”) manually by someone in the butts
    below the target or electronically through a screen next to the shooter. Each shot scores between 0 and 5 points with
    each inner bullseye (or “V-Bull”) scoring an additional .1, meaning that the highest possible score for 10 rounds
    is 50.10.

    In many cases, a coach will be alongside each shooter plotting their shots and helping them to improve their
    shooting and score.

    We can lend rifles and shooting kit while at Bisley and under supervision if you need to borrow them.

    Safety is always our primary consideration and there are very clear rules and associated checks that cover the
    firing, transportation and storage of rifles and ammunition. New members will have all safety requirements fully
    explained to them.
