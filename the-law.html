<p>
    UK firearms law, as laid out in the Firearms Acts 1968, and soon to be updated to 2023, is some of the
    most controlled and cautious in the World. As a result we have amongst the lowest firearms injury and
    death rates from accidents and criminal activities anywhere.
</p>
<p>
    While you will find plenty of firearms shooters that casually moan about the restrictions placed upon us,
    most will admit that they are a very good thing, and keep us and our families safer.
</p>

<h2>Probation</h2>
<p>
    The law requires all new members of firearms clubs to serve a minimum six month probationary period,
    sufficient for the club committee members to determine that the new member is safe, follows safety instructions and is of good character.
</p>
<p>
    After this, full Club membership may be granted, and a membership card issued, as well as a Safer Shooter Certificate (SSC), an essential card that allows you to shoot on NRA ranges.
</p>

<h2>Firearms Certificate</h2>
<p>
    If you are not already a firearms certificate holder, as a full Club member, you may apply to your local
    police firearms licensing department for a firearms certificate to own and keep a rifle. Part of this process will involve the police requiring a medical statement from your doctor.
</p>
<p>
    You will need to install a compliant gun cabinet. Nobody but you may know where you keep the keys.

</p>
<p>
    Once all this is completed, the local firearms licensing officer will visit your home to interview you,
    double-checking that you are indeed of good character. They will also check your gun cabinet is suitable.
</p>
<p>
    We will help and advise you throughout this process.
