title: Let's Shoot
---

<p>
    Now you have arrived at Bisley Camp, met at least one of our members, who has shown you around the
    camp a little, perhaps joined us for a coffee or lunch in one of the clubhouses, it's time to shoot!
</p>
<p>
    You will drive over to the particular range and firing point we have been allocated by the NRA Office. We
    will add you to our WhatsApp group so that you will have received a message in the morning with the
    Target Number and range , for example ‘Century Target 62’
</p>
<p>
    Drive to the parking area at the very rear of the range, and park near to the target number.
</p>
<p>
    Other Club members will be getting ready by their cars, or have already walked to the firing point.
    We will explain the safety rules you need for the day, and what is going to happen.

<p>
    When it’s your turn to shoot, we’ll help you get kitted up, and set up on the firing point.
    We usually have two people coaching each shooter.
</p>
<p>
    We’ll tell you what to do. All you do is aim and shoot when told to and you are ready. We will adjust
    your sights for the wind conditions, and we will plot each shot on your scorecard, so you have a record of
    how you did and what your sight adjustments were, essential for next time you shoot.
