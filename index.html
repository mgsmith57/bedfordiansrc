    Welcome to the Bedfordians Rifle Club website!
</p>

<p>
    We are a small and very friendly fullbore target rifle club open to Old Bedfordians and their families and current
    students at Bedford School.
</p>

<p>
    The Club has been going for nearly 50 years and, in that time, we’ve developed a strong reputation for marksmanship
    and our overall contribution to fullbore target rifle shooting. Some of our members have represented the country at
    international level, while others shoot purely for the fun of it and without major competitive aspirations.
</p>

<p>
    Most of our shooting takes place at the world famous Bisley Camp in Surrey, ranging from midweek and weekend
    practice shoots, internal Club competitions, inter-club competitions and big setpiece international competitions
    such as the Imperial Meeting that takes place at Bisley in July each year.
</p>

<p>
    One of the most remarkable aspects of target rifle shooting, almost unique in sport, is that it can be enjoyed almost
    regardless of age, gender or disability.
</p>

<p>
    The Club is today made up of OBs and now increasingly their sons and daughters who did not attend Bedford School,
    but who share a love of target rifle shooting. National team captains, county level shooters and those less
    experienced all mix and shoot together, providing support and guidance in a relaxed atmosphere of friendship.
    This makes target rifle shooting the most active and successful OB sport with the widest age range of active members
    and competitors.
