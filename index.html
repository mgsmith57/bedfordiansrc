<p>
    The Bedfordians Rifle Club is for past and present pupils of Bedford School, and their families.
</p>

<p>
    We are a social and sporting club, shooting prone fullbore 'Target Rifle' shooting, as classified by the National
    Rifle Association (NRA) in the UK. We are affiliated with the NRA.
</p>

<p>
    This shooting discipline is almost unique amongst all sports, in that regardless of gender, age or physical
    ability, all compete side by side on the firing point on equal terms. Indeed, prone rifle shooting is especially
    suited to those with some limits to their physical ability.
</p>

<p>
    We shoot as a club in team events against other rifle clubs, as a group on practice days, in internal club
    competitions and as individuals, in regional, national and international events in the UK and abroad.
</p>

<p>
    We are a very relaxed and friendly club, as our moto WOHFTBNTBS suggests (read on for an explanation).
    Our only exception to informality is where safety and the law is concerned.
</p>

<p>
    We have a long history of members that have shot and continue to do so, at county, national and international level. And now some of our younger members, daughters and sons of the original members, are
    international team members themselves.
</p>

<p>
    However some members have little interest in formal competitions, rather preferring to challenge themselves to achieving a personal best, in organising club events and coaching others on the firing point, or
    simply enjoying the mindfulness and focus that this precision sport demands.
</p>

<p>
    All are equally welcome! What is most important to us all is simply to have fun and enjoy ourselves,
    whether on the rifle range or in the club house over a meal and a drink together.
</p>

<p>
    Most of all, you will find that everyone is very helpful in getting you into shooting, both with advice and
    coaching, to whichever level you aspire.
</p>

<p>
    Do come along, we look forward to meeting you.
