title: Bedfordians Rifle Club
---
<p>
    This very active Club competes in a number of competitions at Bisley each year, and the Imperial Meeting in July,
    the biggest and most famous event in the world of target rifle shooting, sees a good representation of OBs usually
    with a considerable degree of success!
</p>
<p>
    The Club is open to OBs and current Bedfordians (and their families) who would like to experience full bore shooting
    again or for the first time.
