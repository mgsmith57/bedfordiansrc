title: Fullbore Shooting
---

<p>
    Though not a requirement of joining the BRC, our members mostly were members of the School's Rifle
    Club, shooting the school's 0.22 calibre rifles. So they had a good understanding of prone rifle shooting.
</p>
<p>
    The prone fullbore 'Target Rifle' discipline is very similar to that shot at Bedford School in the Miniature
    Range except: we use a larger 7.62mm/0.308" calibre rifle, weâ€™re outside in all weathers, we shoot at far longer ranges
    of 300 yards to 1000 yards usually.

    Apart from a larger rifle than the School's 0.22 calibre rifles, other equipment is the same:
    A shooting jacket and single point sling, a padded shooting mit or glove for the sling arm, a hat, ear defenders, a padded shooting mat, a spotting telescope.
    Additional accessories include a breach flag, score book, weather resistant clipboard, small towel such as
    a beer-towel, bullet box, waterproof shooting coat, and a kit bag for all this.

    This may seem expensive, and like any hobby, it is possible to spend a lot, however it is also possible to
    start off with a second-hand rifle and kit for a fraction of the cost of new, and shoot perfectly well. Members will
    advise you and help you find kit through our network of shooting friends.

    Initially, as a club probationary member, we will lend club kit and a rifle on the day.
